# About minute

**minute** is a user-friendly Snakemake workflow to perform the primary analysis 
steps of a MINUTE-ChIP dataset. **minute** takes as input a set of paired-end,
multiplexed FASTQ files and a minimal configuration and outputs demultiplexed
FASTQ files, BAM alignments and minute-scaled bigWig files that can be used for
further quantitative downstream analysis and visualization.

**minute** is available under the terms of the MIT license.
