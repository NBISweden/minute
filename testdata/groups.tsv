# List of treatment libraries paired with their controls (inputs)
#
# Columns: treatment sample name, replicate id, control sample name, scaling group, reference name
#
# - The replicate id can also be set to "pooled", in which case all libraries for that sample
#   that are listed in libraries.tsv are pooled together
# - The scaling group is an arbitrary name. Treatment/control pairs that have the same name are
#   put into the same scaling group.
# - The reference name is a reference defined in config.yaml
